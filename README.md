---

# **DSA Visualizer**  

## **Overview**  
**DSA Visualizer** is an interactive web-based application designed to help users understand fundamental data structures through visual representation. Built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** for the frontend, **Django (Python)** for the backend, and **MySQL** for data management, this project offers an engaging way to learn key data structures such as **Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, and Queues**.  

## **Key Features**  
ðŸ”¹ **Interactive Visualizations** â€“ Step-by-step animations showcasing insertions, deletions, and traversals of data structures.  
ðŸ”¹ **User Input Support** â€“ Allows users to create and manipulate data structures with custom inputs.  
ðŸ”¹ **Algorithm Execution** â€“ Visualizes various operations like push/pop (Stack), enqueue/dequeue (Queue), and node insertion/deletion (Linked List).  
ðŸ”¹ **Backend Processing** â€“ Uses Django to handle user requests and provide dynamic responses.  
ðŸ”¹ **Database Integration** â€“ MySQL stores user progress, custom structures, and settings.  
ðŸ”¹ **Responsive UI** â€“ Ensures smooth performance across different devices.  

## **Technology Stack**  
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (for animations and interactivity)  
- **Backend**: Python (Django framework for handling logic and APIs)  
- **Database**: MySQL (to store user data and structure configurations)  

## **Use Cases**  
âœ… Ideal for students and developers learning Data Structures.  
âœ… Helps in understanding concepts through real-time visualization.  
âœ… Can be used as a teaching tool in academic institutions.  

## **Future Enhancements**  
ðŸš€ Addition of sorting and searching algorithm visualizations.  
ðŸš€ Support for advanced data structures like Trees and Graphs.  
ðŸš€ User authentication and personalized progress tracking.
